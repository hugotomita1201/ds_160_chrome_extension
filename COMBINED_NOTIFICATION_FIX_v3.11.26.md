# Combined Languages and Countries Notification - v3.11.26

## Problem
When both languages and countries were present on the Additional Work/Education page, only one notification would appear (either languages OR countries). This was because each notification was overwriting the previous one since `showUnifiedNotification` removes existing notifications before showing new ones.

## Solution
Created a new combined notification function `showLanguagesAndCountriesNotification` that displays both languages and countries information in a single notification with multiple sections.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Combined Notification Function (lines 5147-5185)
```javascript
showLanguagesAndCountriesNotification(languageCount, countriesCount)
```
- Combines both languages and countries into a single notification
- Shows languages section if `languageCount > 0` (not just > 1)
- Shows countries section if `countriesCount > 0` (not just > 1)
- Handles singular/plural correctly (1 Language vs 2 Languages)

### 2. Updated Trigger Logic (3 locations)
Changed from separate calls:
```javascript
if (languageCount > 1) {
  this.showMultipleLanguagesNotification(languageCount);
}
if (countriesCount > 1) {
  this.showMultipleCountriesVisitedNotification(countriesCount);
}
```

To combined call:
```javascript
if (languageCount > 0 || countriesCount > 0) {
  this.showLanguagesAndCountriesNotification(languageCount, countriesCount);
}
```

### 3. Improved Visibility
- Now shows notification even for 1 language or 1 country (previously required > 1)
- Both pieces of information appear in a single notification
- No more overwriting issues

## Example Output
When user has 1 language and 5 countries:
```
üìã Additional Work/Education Information

üó£Ô∏è 1 Language Spoken
The extension will fill up to 5 languages.

Languages to be filled:
1. ENGLISH

Field ID: dtlLANGUAGES_ctl[N]_tbxLANGUAGE_NAME

‚úàÔ∏è 5 Countries Visited in Last 5 Years

Countries to be filled:

2. CHINA

```

## Benefits
- Both languages and countries information visible at once
- No more missing notifications due to overwriting
- Better user experience with consolidated information
- Shows notification even for single entries (helpful for verification)

## Version Update
Updated extension version from 3.11.25 to 3.11.26 to reflect this fix.

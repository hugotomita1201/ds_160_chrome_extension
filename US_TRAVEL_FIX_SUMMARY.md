# US Travel History Fix - Version 3.11.2

## Problem
The notification was showing "5 Previous US Visits Found" but only the first visit was filling correctly. Visit 2 was partially filling (date but no length of stay) and visit 3 wasn't filling at all.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Dynamic Field Creation**: The DS-160 form doesn't create all visit fields by default. Additional visit fields (ctl01, ctl02, etc.) are only created when the user clicks "Add Another" button.

2. **Field Mapping Issue**: The extension was trying to fill fields that didn't exist on the page yet, causing silent failures.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- US travel data structure
- Date parsing results for each visit
- Field existence checking
- Special logging for PREV_US_VISIT fields

### 2. Improved Field Mapping
Changed from static field mapping to dynamic field mapping using spread operators to only include fields when data exists:
```javascript
// Visit 2 (ctl01) - Only adds fields if visit2 data exists
...(() => {
  const visit2 = data.previousTravel?.visits?.[1];
  if (visit2) {
    console.log('Filling Visit 2:', visit2);
    return {
      // field mappings
    };
  }
  return {};
})(),
```

### 3. Enhanced Notification System
Updated the notification to:
- Check which visit fields are actually present on the page
- Show field availability status (Visit 1 ✓, Visit 2 ✓, etc.)
- Provide clear instructions when fields are missing
- Tell users to click "Add Another" button and then re-run Auto-Fill

### 4. Field Existence Checking
Added real-time checking for field presence:
```javascript
const visit1Exists = !!document.getElementById('ctl00_SiteContentPlaceHolder_FormView1_dtlPREV_US_VISIT_ctl00_ddlPREV_US_VISIT_DTEDay');
const visit2Exists = !!document.getElementById('ctl00_SiteContentPlaceHolder_FormView1_dtlPREV_US_VISIT_ctl01_ddlPREV_US_VISIT_DTEDay');
```

## User Instructions
When you have multiple US visits:
1. Click the Auto-Fill button
2. The extension will fill the first visit and show a notification
3. Click "Add Another" button on the form to create more visit fields
4. Click Auto-Fill again to fill the newly created fields
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each additional visit

## Testing Notes
The parseDate function correctly handles the "DD-MMM-YYYY" format (e.g., "02-JUL-2024"):
- Day: Extracts as number without leading zeros for dropdown
- Month: Converts month abbreviation to numeric value ("JUL" → "07")
- Year: Extracts as 4-digit year

## Version Update
Updated to version 3.11.2 with these fixes.
